"4. Type <code>@unobot</code> into your chat box and hit <b>space</b>, or "
"click the <code>via @unobot</code> text next to messages. You will see your "
"cards (some greyed out), any extra options like drawing, and a <b>?</b> to "
"see the current game state. The <b>greyed out cards</b> are those you <b>can "
"not play</b> at the moment. Tap an option to execute the selected action.\n"
"Players can join the game at any time. To leave a game, use /leave. If a "
"player takes more than 90 seconds to play, you can use /skip to skip that "
"player. Use /notify_me to receive a private message when a new game is "
"started.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Language</b> and other settings: /settings\n"
"Other commands (only game creator):\n"
"/close - Close lobby\n"
"/open - Open lobby\n"
"/kill - Terminate the game\n"
"/kick - Select a player to kick by replying to him or her\n"
"/enable_translations - Translate relevant texts into all languages spoken in "

"To change the game mode, the GAME CREATOR has to type the bot nickname and a "
